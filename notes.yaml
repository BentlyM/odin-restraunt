what are some ways you can render each card?:
  - possibly using some event lister (the event listener variable will be export by each file) it when grab that variable and call back the function allowing the page to render
  - possibly use a if statement or switch statement to pick up when a button is pressed redirecting the user to a different layout/component
method 2:
  - load the event listeners the same way
  - instead export the init with functions that can be called in index.js which can control the navigation of layouts if a certain button is clicked


how will you render the specific layouts?:
  - separate javascript for each layout homeLayout , menuLayout , contactLayout
  - use the init.js to load each page when event is called
  - use index.js to .remove() nodes regrading the particular page (just a recommendation ) there are other ways


idea:
  - use a singular function to dynamically figure out the button pressed triggering a closest method to activate that alters page layouts
